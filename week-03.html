<h1 id="week-3-introduction-to-algorithms">Week 3: Introduction to
algorithms</h1>
<p>This week we learn what the building blocks of algorithms are, we
learn how to reason about algorithms and their correctness, and we get
started on the first mandatory project (of which you can choose between
two).</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>In the exercises this week there are both algorithmic questions and
programming questions. You do not need to implement any of the
algorithms—it is more important that you manage to design the algorithms
themselves—but I strongly encourage you to implement what you can, since
you will learn a lot more from trying to tell the computer what your
ideas are, than just telling yourself of a study-mate.</p>
<h3 id="merging">Merging</h3>
<p>Assume you have two sorted lists, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,
and you want to combine them into a new sequence, <code>z</code>, that
contains all the elements from <code>x</code> and all the elements from
<code>y</code>, in sorted order. You can create <code>z</code> by
<em>merging</em> <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as follows: have an
index, <code>i</code>, into <code>x</code> and another index,
<code>j</code>, into <code>y</code>—both initially zero—and compare
<code>x[i]</code> with <code>y[j]</code>. If
<code>x[i] &lt; y[j]</code>, then append <code>x[i]</code> to
<code>z</code> and increment <code>i</code> by one. Otherwise, append
<code>y[j]</code> to <code>z</code> and increment <code>j</code>. If
either <code>i</code> reaches the length of <code>x</code> or
<code>j</code> reaches the end of <code>y</code>, simply copy the
remainder of the other list to <code>z</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Argue why this approach creates the
correct <code>z</code> list and why it terminates.</p>
<p>Now you get to implement a merge (at least <a
href="https://github.com/birc-ctib/merging">if you go to GitHub and get
the exercise</a>).</p>
<h3 id="below-or-above">Below or above</h3>
<p>Here’s a game you can play with a friend: one of you think of a
number between 1 and 20, both 1 and 20 included. The other has to figure
out what that number is. He or she can guess at the number, and after
guessing will be told if the guess is correct, too high, or is too low.
Unless the guess is correct, the guesser must try again until the guess
<em>is</em> correct.</p>
<p>The game can be implemented like this (<a
href="https://github.com/birc-ctib/guessing">you can get your own
version to play with on GitHub</a>):</p>

<p>In this game, the computer gets to pick the number and you need to
guess it.</p>
<p>Here are three different strategies you could use to guess the
number:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start with one. If it isn’t the right number, it has to be too
low–there are no smaller numbers the right one could be. So if it isn’t
one, you guess it is two. If it isn’t, you have once again guessed too
low, so now you try three. You continue by incrementing your guess by
one until you get the right answer.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you start at 20. If the correct number is 20, great,
you got it in one guess, but if it is not, your guess must be too
high—it cannot possibly be too small. So, you try 19 instead, and this
time you work your way down until you get the right answer.</li>
<li>Tired of trying all numbers from one end to the other, you can pick
this strategy: you start by guessing 10. If this is correct, you are
done, if it is too high, you know the real number must be in the
interval [1,9], and if the guess is too low, you know the right answer
must be in the interval [11,20]—so for your next guess, you pick the
middle of the interval it must be. With each new guess, you update the
range where the real number can hide and choose the middle of the
previous range.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Prove that all three strategies terminate
and with the correct answer, i.e. they are algorithms for solving this
problem.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Would you judge all three approaches to be
equally efficient in finding the right number? If not, how would you
order the three strategies such that the method most likely to get the
correct number first is ranked highest, and the algorithm most likely to
get the right number last is rated lowest. Justify your answer.</p>
<p>In the GitHub code there is also a version of the program where you
get to pick the number and the computer guesses.</p>
<p>If you do not lie to the computer when it asks you about its guess
compared to the number you are thinking of, the program implements the
first strategy (going in sequence from 1 to 20).</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Implement the other two strategies and
test them.</p>
<p>When iterating from 20 and down, for the second strategy, you should
always get the result <code>"high"</code> when you ask about your guess,
so you can use a <code>for</code> loop and not worry about the actual
result form <code>input_selection</code>. When you implement strategy
number three, however, you need to keep track of a candidate interval
with a lower bound, initially 1, and an upper bound, initially 20. If
you guess too high, you should lower your upper bound to the value you
just guessed minus one (no need to include the guess we know is too
high). If you guess too low, you must increase your lower bound to the
number you just guessed plus one. In both cases, after updating the
interval, you should guess for the middle point in the new range. When
you compute the middle value in your interval, you can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>guess <span class="op">=</span> (upper_bound <span class="op">+</span> lower_bound) <span class="op">//</span> <span class="dv">2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="sieve-of-eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</h3>
<p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of
Eratosthenes</a> is an early algorithm for computing all prime numbers
less than some upper bound n. It works as follows: we start with a set
of candidates for numbers that could be primes, and since we do not a
priori know which numbers will be primes we start with all the natural
numbers from two and up to n.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>candidates <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">list</span>(<span class="bu">range</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, n <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We are going to figure out which are primes by elimination and put
the primes in another list that is initially empty.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>primes <span class="op">=</span> []</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The trick now is to remove from the candidates the numbers we know
are not primes. We will require the following loop invariants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All numbers in <code>primes</code> are prime.</li>
<li>No number in <code>candidates</code> can be divided by a number in
<code>primes</code>.</li>
<li>The smallest number in <code>candidates</code> is a prime.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Prove that the invariants are true with
the initial lists defined as above.</p>
<p>We will now loop as long as there are candidates left. In the loop,
we take the smallest number in the <code>candidates</code> list, which
by the invariant must be a prime. Call it p. We then remove all
candidates that are divisible by p and then add p to
<code>primes</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Prove that the invariants are satisfied
after these steps whenever they are satisfied before the steps.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Prove that this algorithm terminates and
is correct, i.e., that <code>primes</code> once the algorithm terminates
contain all primes less than or equal to n. Correctness does not follow
directly from the invariants so you might have to extend them.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> <a
href="https://github.com/birc-ctib/sieve">Implement and test this
algorithm.</a></p>
<h3 id="longest-increasing-substrings">Longest increasing
substrings</h3>
<p>Assume you have a list of numbers, for example</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="dv">12</span>, <span class="dv">45</span>, <span class="dv">32</span>, <span class="dv">65</span>, <span class="dv">78</span>, <span class="dv">23</span>, <span class="dv">35</span>, <span class="dv">45</span>, <span class="dv">57</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Design an algorithm that finds the longest
sub-sequence <code>x[i:j]</code> such that consecutive numbers are
increasing, i.e. <code>x[k] &lt; x[k+1]</code> for all <code>k</code> in
<code>range(i,j)</code> (or the left-most, if there are more than one
with the same length).</p>
<p>A brute-force approach is to explore all
<code>0 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt; n</code> and check if <code>x[i:j]</code> is
increasing, and then pick the longest of them. It is not particularly
efficient, though, and there are smarter ways.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> One way to approach this is to consider the longest
sequence seen so far and the longest sequence up to a given index into
<code>x</code>. From this, you can formalise invariants that should get
you through.</p>
<p>If you want to try implementing your algorithm you can <a
href="https://github.com/birc-ctib/lis">start from here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="computing-power-sets">Computing power-sets</h3>
<p>The <em>power-set</em> P(S) of a set S is the set that contains all
possible subsets of S. For example, if <code>S={a,b,c}</code>, then</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>S</em>) = {∅, {<em>a</em>}, {<em>b</em>}, {<em>c</em>}, {<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>}, {<em>a</em>, <em>c</em>}, {<em>b</em>, <em>c</em>}, {<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>}}</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Assume that S is represented as a list.
Design an algorithm that prints out all possible subsets of S. Prove
that it terminates and is correct.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> You can solve this problem by combining the numerical
base algorithm with an observation about the binary representation of a
number and a subset of S. We can represent any subset of S by the
indices into the list representation of S. Given the indices, just pick
out the elements at those indices. One way to represent a list of
indices is as a binary sequence. The indices of the bits that are 1
should be included, the indices where the bits are 0 should not. If you
can generate all the binary vectors of length <code>n = len(S)</code>,
then you have implicitly generated all subsets of S. You can get all
these bit vectors by getting all the numbers from zero to <span
class="math inline">2<sup><em>n</em></sup></span> and extracting the
binary representation.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://github.com/birc-ctib/powerset">want to
implement a solution based on this approach,</a> you don’t need to find
your old code. You can already compute a string that works as a binary
representation of a number.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>bits <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">format</span>(i, <span class="st">&quot;b&quot;</span>).zfill(<span class="bu">len</span>(x))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>format(i, "b")</code> converts <code>i</code> into binary
and the <code>zfill</code> then makes sure that the string is
<code>len(x)</code> long by padding with zeros.</p>
<h3 id="longest-increasing-subsequences">Longest increasing
subsequences</h3>
<p>Notice that this problem has a different name than “longest
increasing <em>substring</em>”; it is a slightly different problem.
Assume, again, that you have a list of numbers. We want to find the
longest sub-sequence of increasing numbers, but this time we are not
looking for consecutive indices <code>i:j</code>, but a sequence of
indices <code>i[0], i[1], …, i[m]</code> such that
<code>i[k] &lt; i[k + 1]</code> and
<code>x[i[k]] &lt; x[i[k+1]]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong> Design an <em>algorithm</em> for computing
the longest (or a longest) such sequence of indices
<code>i[0], i[1], …, i[m]</code>.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> This problem is harder than the previous one, but you
can brute force it by generating <em>all</em> subsequences and checking
if the invariant is satisfied. This is a <em>very</em> inefficient
approach, but you need to learn a little more about algorithms before we
will see a more efficient solution (and it won’t be in this class,
sorry).</p>
<p>If you want to implement your solution, <a
href="https://github.com/birc-ctib/liseq">here’s a template for
you</a>.</p>
<h3 id="changing-base">Changing base</h3>
<p>When we write a number such as 123 we usually mean this to be in base
10, that is, we implicitly understand this to be the number <span
class="math inline">3 × 10<sup>0</sup> + 2 × 10<sup>1</sup> + 1 × 10<sup>2</sup></span>.
Starting from the right and moving towards the left, each digit
represents an increasing power of tens. The number <em>could</em> also
be in octal, although then we would usually write it like <span
class="math inline">123<sub>8</sub></span>. If the number were in octal,
each digit would represent a power of eight, and the number should be
understood as <span
class="math inline">3 × 8<sup>0</sup> + 2 × 8<sup>1</sup> + 3 × 8<sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers—notation where the bases are 2,
8, and 16, respectively—are frequently used in computer science as they
capture the numbers you can put in one, three and four bits. The
computer works with bits, so it naturally speaks binary. For us humans,
binary is a pain because it requires long sequences of ones and zeros
for even relatively small numbers, and it is hard for us to readily see
if we have five or six or so zeroes or ones in a row.</p>
<p>Using octal and hexadecimal is more comfortable for humans than
binary, and you can map the digits in octal and hexadecimal to three and
four-bit numbers, respectively. Modern computers are based on bytes (and
multiples of bytes) where a byte is eight bits. Since a hexadecimal
number is four bits, you can write any number that fits into a byte
using two hexadecimal digits rather than eight binary digits. Octal
numbers are less useful on modern computers, since two octal digits, six
bits, are too small for a byte while three octal digits, nine bits, are
too larger. Some older systems, however, were based on 12-bits numbers,
and there you had four octal numbers. Now, octal numbers are merely used
for historical reasons; on modern computers, hexadecimal numbers are
better.</p>
<p>Leaving computer science, base 12, called duodecimal, has been
proposed as a better choice than base 10 for doing arithmetic because 12
has more factors than 10 and this system would be simpler to do
multiplication and division in. It is probably unlikely that this idea
gets traction, but if it did, we would have to get used to converting
old decimal numbers into duodecimal.</p>
<p>In this exercise, we do not want to do arithmetic in different bases
but want to write a function that prints an integer in different
bases.</p>
<p>When the base is higher than 10, we need a way to represent the
digits from 10 and up. There are proposed special symbols for these, and
these can be found in Unicode, but we will use letters, as is typically
done for hexadecimal. We won’t go above base 16, so we can use this
table to map a number to a digit up to that base:</p>

<p>To get the last digit in a number, in base <code>b</code>, we can
take the division rest, the modulus, and map that using the
<code>digits</code> table:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>digits[i <span class="op">%</span> b]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Try it out.</p>
<p>You can extract the base-b representation of a number by building a
list of digits starting with the smallest. You can use
<code>digits[i % b]</code> to get the last digit and remember that in a
list. Then we need to move on to the next digit. Now, if the number we
are processing is
<code>n = b**0 * a[0] + b**1 * a[1] + b**2 * a[2] + … + b**n a[m]</code>,
then <code>a[0]</code> is the remainder in a division by <code>b</code>
and the digit we just extracted. Additionally, if // denotes integer
division,
<code>n // b = b**0 * a[1] + b**1 * a[2] + … b**(m-1) * a[m]</code>. So,
we can get the next digit by first dividing n by b and then extract the
smallest digit.</p>
<p>If you iteratively extract the lowest digit and put it in a list and
then reduce the number by dividing it by b, you should eventually have a
list with all the digits, although in reverse order. If your list is
named <code>lst</code>, you can reverse it using this expression
<code>lst[::-1]</code>. The expression says that we want
<code>lst</code> from the beginning to the end—the default values of a
range when we do not provide anything—in steps of minus one.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Flesh out an algorithm, based on the
observations above, that can print any integer in any base <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> ≤ 16</span>. Show that your method
terminates and outputs the correct string of digits.</p>
<p>If you feel up to it, you can try implementing the algorithm (<a
href="https://github.com/birc-ctib/changing-base">here’s a link to a
GitHub exercise</a>).</p>
<p>Be warned, though. While the algorithm is sound, there are special
cases we didn’t consider. I know many people who use this problem as an
interview question exactly because the number of special cases (that
depend on programming language, number representations, phases of the
moon and much more) makes it so interesting. But give it a go!</p>
